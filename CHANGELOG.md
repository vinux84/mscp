# Changelog

## [3.4.26] - 2026-06-27
- Smart Bar: Fix large camera loading freezing it.

## [3.4.25] - 2026-06-26
- Add RTSP Driver: UDP Multicast transport. The per-channel Transport Protocol now offers "UDP Multicast", which joins the camera's multicast RTP group instead of receiving a unicast stream. Useful when many viewers share one camera on a multicast-enabled LAN. The camera must publish a multicast destination and the network must allow multicast end to end.
- Add System Status: Milestone Federated Architecture support. The **System Health** window now enumerates the master site and all federated child sites, so a parent site with no recording server of its own still shows the recorders, cameras, storage and users of its child sites. Each site is queried with its own session token and message channel, and the recorder, camera and user tables gain a **Site** column (shown only when more than one site is present). CSV exports include the site.
- Add System Status: Background recording-range pre-warm. First and last recorded timestamps are now loaded for every camera in the background from the moment the Smart Client starts (paced, two recorders at a time) and cached, instead of being queried for all cameras at once when the window opens. The window reads the cache and shows each cell as a value, **Loading** while it is still pending, or **error** if it failed. The cache is fully rescanned every 30 minutes. This resolves the `SequencesGetAroundWithSpan` 60 second WCF timeout seen on systems with many cameras.
- Improve System Status: Rich timing diagnostics in MIPLog. Each recording-range query logs its per-phase (last / first) duration and flags slow or timed-out queries with the camera name and elapsed time. Each background range sweep logs a batch summary (min / avg / max / p95 / slowest). Each per-recorder fetch logs the duration of every status-service call (status, recording storage, archive storage, statistics) and flags any recorder slower than the threshold with the per-call breakdown.

## [3.4.24] - 2026-06-26

## [3.4.23] - 2026-06-26
- Add System Status: Summary header chips on the **System Health** window - **Recorders**, **Cameras**, **Cameras Offline** and **Storage Alerts**. The two problem chips appear only when their count is above zero. An **About** button shows the plugin version.
- Add System Status: Recording Servers table gains a **Cameras** column (online / total per recorder, online in green and total in blue) and a **Bandwidth** column (the recorder's aggregate live bandwidth, summed across its cameras).
- Improve System Status: Bitrate and bandwidth figures now scale their unit with the value (kB/s, MB/s, GB/s) across the camera, stream and recorder tables, so large totals stay readable.

## [3.4.21] - 2026-06-22
- Add RTSP Driver: RTSPS (RTSP over TLS) transport. The per-channel Transport Protocol now offers "RTSPS (TLS, verify certificate)" and "RTSPS Untrusted (TLS, skip certificate check)" for cameras that serve RTSP over TLS, including those with self-signed certificates. TLS is handled by the bundled FFmpeg build (Windows SChannel), so no extra components are required.
- Improve RTSP Driver: Raised the maximum number of channels per driver instance from 4 to 16.
- Improve RTSP Driver: Connection timeouts now show a readable "Connection timed out after Ns" message instead of the raw "Error number -138 occurred" (FFmpeg ETIMEDOUT on Windows).
- Fix System Status: Recording servers could be undercounted in the overview (e.g. 2 shown of 3 present). The config-based recorder enumeration aborted on the first problematic recording server, discarded the recorders already collected, and fell back to the login-scoped device-tree walk - which surfaces fewer recorders than exist. Each recording server is now enumerated in isolation, so one offline or misconfigured recorder is skipped without hiding the others.
- Improve System Status: The exact reason a recording server is skipped is now written to MIPLog (exception type and message, plus inner exception), instead of only a generic "enumeration failed" line.

## [3.4.18] - 2026-06-11
- Fix Metadata Display: Revert LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharpView.WPF version because it introduce a DLL loading issue. GH Issue: #146
- Improve Installer: Made all components OPT-In. GH Feature Request: #144
- Improve Metadata Viewer: Add more filters and exclusion topic via context menus like wireshark: #145

## [3.4.14] - 2026-06-07
- Improve Project: Various internal CI and GH repo improvments regarding to openssf.

## [3.4.11] - 2026-06-06
- Add System Status: **Folder & Role - Camera User Status** view item - a tile with two live lists, **Camera Folders** (online / total cameras per device-tree folder) and **Roles** (logged-in / total users per role). In setup mode the tile shows a centered **Open configuration...** button that opens a split window with the settings on the left and a live preview of the tile on the right.
- Improve System Status: The view item is fully configurable - show all folders and roles or pick them individually, a **Show** mode (all / cameras only / roles only), recording-server prefix toggle, sort (alphabetical or most-offline-first), and styling (text size, count color, offline highlight, row spacing). A **Render mode** switches between **List** (rows) and **Dashboard** (rectangular cards) with a configurable card minimum width.

## [3.4.10] - 2026-06-05
- Fix System Status: Camera recording traversal.
- Improve System Status: Allow camera grouping by folders.

## [3.4.8] - 2026-06-05
- Fix System Status: Camera bitrate now shows kB/s, matching the per-stream value.
- Improve System Status: First / last recording and span are now shown as chips.
- Improve System Status: Standalone SDK logins show as **Integration / SDK client** instead of "Unknown OAuth user".
- Maintenance Deps: Dependency updates (WebView2, Newtonsoft.Json, BouncyCastle, LiveChartsCore, ILRepack).

## [3.4.4] - 2026-06-04
- Add System Status: **System Health** window - the toolbar button now opens a near-fullscreen, resizable window with three tables: **Recording Servers** (per-storage usage bar coloured green/orange/red, attach/connection state), **Cameras** (live FPS / bitrate / resolution / codec, used storage and its **% of the recorder's configured storage**, first/last recording and a compact recorded **span**), and **Users**.

## [3.4.3] - 2026-06-02
- Improve System Status: Now a full status overview around **RS**, **Cameras**, **Streams** and **Users**.

## [3.4.2] - 2026-06-02
- Improve Flex View: Pane copy.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-05-29
- Add Auto Exporter: New standalone application for scheduled and rule-triggered exports.
- Add System Help: New Smart Client toolbar plugin.

## [3.2.9] - 2026-05-28
- Remove Metadata Display: **Learn mode**, **Inspect packet**, and the per-channel packet cache are gone. The configuration window is now driven entirely by **Pick packet** (renamed from History) and **Import packet** - both populate Topic and Field from a real packet, and the live source keeps the preview updating after a pick. Additional series rows lose their per-row Learn buttons and gain their own Pick packet alongside Import packet.
- Fix Metadata Display: **Pick packet** and **Import packet** now switch to the picked packet's topic even when a topic was already selected. Previously the prior topic was preserved silently and the operator had to reopen the Topic dropdown to select the new one.
- Improve Metadata Display: Setup-mode pane collapses the Channel / Render / Topic / Data key summary on slots smaller than 300x220 px, leaving only the plugin title and **Open configuration...** button so small left-column slots stay readable.
- Improve Flex View: Edit mode now labels non-camera plugin slots with the plugin's display name (e.g. "Metadata Display", "Remote Manager"). Camera slots keep their camera-name label; built-in view items (Hotspot, Carousel, etc.) and tiny slots stay unlabeled.

## [3.2.5] - 2026-05-27
- Add Metadata Display: **History** button next to Import packet. Opens a browser of recorded packets from the selected channel (1h / 6h / 24h / 7d lookback) with search, an XML preview pane, and a "Use selected packet" action that populates Topics and Fields exactly like Import packet. Useful for cameras that publish events rarely, where Start Learn would otherwise sit idle. The status text under the buttons moved to its own row to make space.
- Fix Flex View: Edit and Save As no longer drop plugin view items (Metadata Display, Remote Manager, etc.) from the layout.

## [3.2.3] - 2026-05-27
- Add Metadata Display: **Import packet** button in the configuration window's "What to read" section and on every Additional series row.
- Add Installer: **Extras folder** on the Local Download Page. Anything dropped into `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\mscp\extras\` on the management server appears as an "Additional downloads" card on `/mscp/`. Wiped on uninstall, preserved across Major Upgrade.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-05-22
- Add Todo List: New Smart Client view-item plugin.
- Improve Remote Manager: Add option to hide the toolbar so the password can't be copied or displayed.

## [3.1.3] - 2026-05-21
- Add Metadata Display: **Base64 Image** render type. Renders an image carried in the metadata value as a base64-encoded string (raw or `data:image/...;base64,...` form). Empty payloads show "No Image"; non-decodable payloads show "Decode error: <reason>" in the Bad color so the operator can distinguish a missing value from a malformed one.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-05-21
- Add Live Exporter: New Smart Client toolbar plugin for the Live workspace. Opens a flyout that mirrors the most recently clicked camera (tile click, legacy Map click, Smart Map click, camera-tree pick) in independent playback with its own scrubber. Operator scrubs to the desired start, clicks Set start, scrubs to the end, clicks Set end, and Add to Export drops the (camera, start to end) pair into the Smart Client's built-in export list with a native confirmation toast. Reset clears the captured times. The flyout follows further camera clicks live so the operator can rapidly mark ranges across multiple cameras.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-05-19
- Security PKI: Any Milestone user was able to extract key material. The role permission was in place but was not correctly applied. Thanks to Josh for this finding.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-16
- Add Remote Control: **SVG Overlay API** - external systems can now draw complex overlays via HTTP API.
- Add PKI: Encryption is now easy as hell =)
- Improve Snapshot Report: Add PDF split possibility.
- Improve Snapshot Report: Add progress bar.
- Fix Snapshot Report: Aspect ratio was not preserved.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-05-07
- Improve Timeline Jump: Add possibility (and setting) for auto switch to current time when entering playback, or on start.
- Improve View Carousel: Works now with all possible MIP items that are not internal, like Maps, Hotspot, Matrix, Alarm List, and Alarm Preview - plus Metadata Display or other widgets from us or any other MIP-defined one.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-05-06
- Add Metadata Display: **Export to CSV** for every render type (Lamp, Number, Gauge, Text, Line Chart, Table).
- Add Metadata Display: **Trend render type**. Compact tile that pairs a big current value with an up / down / neutral arrow, a Δ% versus a configurable baseline, and an inline sparkline of the recent history.
- Add Metadata Display: **Multi-series Line Chart**. A single Line Chart widget can now plot up to 8 series.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-05-05
- Add Metadata Display: **Table** render type.

## [2.7.4] - 2026-05-05
- Fix Web Viewer: Plugin was missing from CI ZIP artifacts and the unified MSI installer because it had no entry in `plugins.json` (the manifest that drives both the build matrix and `installer/generate-wix.ps1`). Added the WebViewer entry under the SmartClient category; the existing `bin/Release/net48` staging rule picks up the WebView2 native loaders (`runtimes/win-{x86,x64,arm64}/native/WebView2Loader.dll`) automatically, no extra staging directives needed.
- Improve Barcode Reader: Quieter helper assembly-resolve logging. Successful resolves no longer write an `AssemblyResolve hit` info line, and `.resources` satellite-assembly probes (e.g. `VideoOS.Platform.resources`) are excluded from the miss-error filter, since those are CLR localization lookups expected to miss on unlocalized binaries. Real misses for `VideoOS.*`, `ZXing.*` and `CommunitySDK` still fire as errors.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-05-05
- Fix Barcode Reader: Helper crash. The helper was unable to find the correct decoding DLLs, which live in the Event Server folder.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-05-04
- Fix Metadata Display: `TypeLoadException` for `LiveChartsCore.CoreAxis`2` `LiveChartsCore`, `LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharpView` and `LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharpView.WPF` are now ILRepacked /internalize'd into `MetadataDisplay.dll` so the chart code resolves against its own private copy regardless of what other plugins ship. SkiaSharp / HarfBuzz remain external (large + native libs).

## [2.7.0] - 2026-05-04
- Add Web Viewer: New Smart Client view item plugin that embeds a single web page in a view item using Microsoft Edge WebView2. One URL per view item with optional title, HTTP Basic credentials (DPAPI-encrypted under the current Windows user), auto-accept of invalid TLS certificates (default on, for in-house dashboards with self-signed certs), and one-shot auto-fill of the basic-auth prompt (default on). For multi-tab / folder-tree usage with both web pages and RDP, use the existing Remote Manager plugin.

## [2.6.6] - 2026-05-04
- Add Metadata Display: **Line Chart** render type. Time-series view of any numeric data key with selectable window (60 seconds up to 24 hours), Mean / Min / Max aggregation into time buckets, optional min/max envelope band, Straight / Smooth / Step line types, configurable color, thickness, fill area and markers, optional dashed warn / critical threshold lines, and zoom and pan (mouse wheel and drag).
- Add Metadata Display: **Live archive backfill** for Line Chart. When the chart appears with a window longer than 60 seconds it is seeded from recorded metadata so the user sees real history immediately instead of waiting for the window to fill from live samples. Switching between Live and Playback or changing the window no longer wipes the visible history.
- Add Metadata Display: **Playback support** for Line Chart. The chart seeds itself at the current playback time on entry (no scrub needed), the cursor line tracks the timeline position, and large jumps trigger a fresh range scan around the new cursor. Zoom and pan are always enabled in playback and the live "Paused" badge is suppressed.
- Add Metadata Display: **In-pane time window picker** for Line Chart (top-right of the chart). Lets viewers temporarily switch the window (60 seconds, 5 / 10 / 30 minutes, 1 / 6 / 24 hours) without entering Setup mode. A **Default** entry reverts to the saved value; an asterisk on the badge label flags an active session override. Override is session-only and never modifies the saved configuration.
- Add Metadata Display: **Loading indicators** while archive backfill runs (cold-start in both Live and Playback, plus after window picker switches).
- Add Metadata Display: **Threshold enable toggle** for Number, Gauge and Line Chart, mirrored across all three render panels. When off, gauges show a single neutral track and the chart hides its threshold lines.
- Improve Metadata Display: **Number widget** value and unit now share a true text baseline so readouts like `43.99 km/h` look like a single piece of typography.
- Improve Metadata Display: **Min / Max chips** redesigned with warn-triangle (lower bound) and critical-circle (upper bound) icons, color-coded to the threshold direction.
- Improve Metadata Display: **Bar gauge** layout - value, unit, and Min/Max scale labels share one row under the bar; ticks moved above; thinner value indicator that does not hide the scale.
- Improve Metadata Display: Default **track thickness** of 6 for arc gauges and 2 for bar gauges (max 20) for a cleaner default look.
- Improve Metadata Display: Setup mode panel scales properly on small panes.
- Improve Metadata Display: Live preview now uses the same "Waiting for data..." indicator as the runtime widget instead of a key=value status line; Line Chart preview is sized 16:9 so the configured shape matches the runtime pane.
- Improve Metadata Display: Configuration window capped at 1280px wide.
- Improve Metadata Display: Diagnostic logging under the `MetadataDisplay` category for chart backfill (start, sample counts, cancellations, faults), playback seeding, and window-picker overrides.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-02
- Add Metadata Display: New Smart Client View Item plugin to display metadata in live and playback mode.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-01
- Add Timeline Jump: New Smart Client toolbar plugin (partner request) for jumping the playback timeline backward or forward by a chosen increment without dragging or scrubbing.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-30
- Add Timelapse: **Apply time window per day** option restricts frames to a daily time-of-day window across the full date range. Use for daylight-only timelapses (e.g. 2 weeks, 08:00 to 17:00 each day) or night-only timelapses with wrap-around windows (e.g. 22:00 to 06:00). Segments are clipped in memory after the server query, so the Recording Sequences card and Output Estimate update without extra round-trips.
- Fix RTMP Driver: Stuttering / dropped recording when the publisher's RTMP timestamps drift ahead of wall-clock.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-29
- Add Colored Timeline: New per-camera selectable-event ribbon plugin (successor to EdgeMotionTimeline). Includes icon picker, marker support, display-name aware rule UI with reduced table footprint, and demo video in the docs.
- Security Installer: Zip-slip hardening (CodeQL #3, `cs/zipslip`, CWE-22 high). `ExtractZipToFolder` now resolves each entry path via `Path.GetFullPath` and validates it is contained within the resolved destination directory (with trailing separator) before extracting. Entries that escape are skipped and logged.
- Fix Barcode Reader: Structured diagnostics for helper failures (#84). Last-chance `UnhandledException` and `UnobservedTaskException` handlers, chatty `OnAssemblyResolve` (logs hits, load failures, and our-dep misses plus the full search-dir list), per-channel on-disk helper log mirrored to `C:\ProgramData\Milestone\BarcodeReader\helper-{itemId}.log` with 5 MB rotation, and typed exit codes (`BackgroundPlugin.MapExitCode` decodes 255 as `NativeCrash`, dumps the last stderr lines and the on-disk log path on death).
- Fix Installer: Management Client process kill targets the actual EXE name. Old image name `VideoOS.Platform.Administration.exe` does not match modern Milestone builds where Management Client runs as `VideoOS.Administration.exe`, so the kill silently no-opped and left the client holding plugin DLLs. Both names are now killed.
- Improve Deps: Dependabot monthly cadence with major-version bumps ignored, reducing churn from breaking upgrades.
- Maintenance Deps: Bump ZXing.Net 0.16.9 → 0.16.11 (#93).
- Maintenance CI: Bump GitHub Actions - `softprops/action-gh-release` 2.6.1 → 2.6.2 (#95), `actions/upload-artifact` 7.0.0 → 7.0.1 (#66), `NuGet/setup-nuget` 3.0.0 → 3.1.0 (#65).

## [2.2.3] - 2026-04-26
- Add Flex View: **Save As** button (visible only when editing an existing view) that duplicates the current view to a new name/folder and carries over camera assignments.
- Add Flex View: Search field in the view picker to filter views by name as you type. Folders auto-expand to reveal matches.
- Add Flex View: Confirmation dialog before opening an existing view explains that saving recreates the view.
- Add RTMP Driver: Per-stream statistics block emitted to the driver log every 30 seconds.
- Add Installer: Optional **Local download page** feature for the management server.
- Fix Flex View: Saving an opened view no longer clears camera assignments. Smart Client rejects `ViewAndLayoutItem.Layout` mutation on an existing view; FlexView now recreates the view and re-attaches each slot's built-in content (Camera, Hotspot, Carousel, Matrix, HTML) via `InsertBuiltinViewItem`.
- Fix Flex View: A `Save` with no edits is now a no-op (was destructively recreating the view).
- Improve Flex View: Save success and error notifications use a custom dark themed dialog matching the rest of the FlexView UI.
- Improve Flex View: Heavy diagnostic logging under the `FlexView` category in `MIPLog.txt` for load and save flows (per-slot snapshot/restore, recreate phases, success/failure summaries).
- Improve RTMP Driver: Parse AMF `@setDataFrame onMetaData` messages so source-declared metadata (width, height, framerate, video / audio bitrate, audio codec, sample rate) ends up in the stats block. Previously the driver silently ignored these messages.
- Improve RTMP Driver: Replaced the per-150-frame and per-20-second ad-hoc log lines with the new periodic stats block.
- Improve Installer: Service stop/start is now gated on the feature action state. Smart Client-only installs no longer stop the Recording Server; admin-plugin-only installs no longer stop the Event Server; driver-only installs no longer stop the Event Server. Process kills (Smart Client, Management Client, Driver Framework) still run unconditionally because they're cheap.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-25
- Improve Timelapse: Continuous and Event-based modes backed by MIP SequenceDataSource (RecordingSequence).
- Improve Timelapse: Preflight card shows sequences, recorded time, and coverage with per-camera breakdown and loading spinner.
- Improve Timelapse: Live segment-aware output estimate (real frame counts, not naive window ÷ interval).
- Improve Timelapse: Multi-camera union timeline with mode-dependent fallbacks (dimmed last frame + badge for Continuous, black "no event" placeholder for Event-based).
- Improve Timelapse: UTC-normalized MIP queries with lookback to catch sequences that span the start of the window.
- Improve Timelapse: Redesigned idle view with card-style layout, bold-Run tooltips, and close-preview button.
- Improve Timelapse: Logging to MIPLog.txt under `Timelapse` and `Timelapse.SequenceQuery` categories.
